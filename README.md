The reported dataset comprises crucial information needed to build a predictive model and consists of a data matrix. This matrix is structured with columns denoting variables and rows representing samples. Variables in the dataset can be divided into three categories: input variables as independent variables, target variables as dependent variables, and unused variables that are neither inputs nor targets. Furthermore, samples can be sorted into training samples, used for creating the model; selection samples, applied for identifying the model with optimal generalization capabilities; testing samples, employed to verify the model's accuracy; and unused samples, which are not engaged in any process. In this study, the solar power generation dataset is obtained from an online source (below given link) containing essential information related to solar power production, which can be used to create predictive models and gain valuable insights into trends and patterns in the solar energy industry.
